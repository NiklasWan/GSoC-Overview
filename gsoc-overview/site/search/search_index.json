If the name is a predicate, the function should return a \"succeeded\" boolean.\"\" Don\u2019t re-invent the kernel macros look in for helpfull macros, to prevent writing your own versions Editor modelines and other cruft Don't include editor configuration options in source files Inline assembly use assembly only when neccessary write helper functions to wrap common parts of inline assembly large non-trivial assembly functions go in .S files, with corresponding C prototypes in C headerfiles corresponding C prototypes for assembly functions should use asmlinkage For single line assembly with multiple instructions: put every instruction on a single line in a separated quoted string Coditional Compilation always try to avoid preprocessor conditionals in .c files, try to use them in .h files, defining functions for use in .c files. For #else case provide no-op stub version of function use IS_ENABLED macro to convert Kconfig symbol into a C boolean expression where possible and use in a normal C conditional References [1] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html Embedded Linux on BBB Before getting started, the required toolchain has to be setup: Development machine runs on Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Steps to compile Linux Kernel: Cross Compiler, Git and lzop: To allow the development machine to compile against a different architecture (in this case ARM), a cross compilation toolchain is needed. Installation is achieved via: sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi To clone required linux repos, install Git: sudo apt-get install git To be able to compress the kernel, install lzop: sudo apt-get install lzop To be able to install Uboot, libssl-dev needs to be installed: sudo apt-get install libssl-dev 2) U-boot: The Beagleboard Black uses the uboot boot loader to boot the system. To install U-Boot first download the latest version using: wget ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/u-boot-<year>.<month>.tar.bz2 Untar with: tar -xjf u-boot-<year>.<month>.tar.bz2 Change into directory: cd u-boot-<year>.<month> Compile Uboot: make sandbox_defconfig tools-only Install mkimage for Uboot image creation: sudo install tools/mkimage /usr/local/bin 3) Get and compile the right kernel: To download the Kernel got to Beagleboard.org GitHub and clone the Linux Kernel: git clone git://github.com/beagleboard/linux.git Change into directory and check out right Branch (we use 4.19-rt): cd linux && git checkout 4.19-rt Configure the Linux Buildsystem with default BBB configuration file: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- bb.org_defconfig Build Linux zImage: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j4 Build Device Tree Binaries and uImage with: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j4 Build kernel modules with: make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- modules -j4 4) Install to BBB via TFTP: To configure BBB for TFTP setup, a USB-to-Serial cable is higly recommended. First insert micro SD Card to Development Machine and create 2 Partitions using i.e. gparted. The first will be the boot partition, so make sure to use fat and enable boot flag. The second will be ext3 and will host the root file system. Copy your root file system to the ext3 partition and copy MLO bootloader and uEnv.txt to the fat boot partition. Configure your uEnv.txt the folowing way: console=ttyO0,115200n8 ipaddr=192.178.27.2 serverip=192.178.27.1 loadaddr=0x82000000 fdtaddr=0x88000000 loadfromsd=tftp ${loadaddr} uImage;tftp ${fdtaddr} am335x-boneblack.dtb linuxbootargs=setenv bootargs console=${console} root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw uenvcmd=setenv autoload no; run loadfromsd; run linuxbootargs; bootm ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr} To configure Linux Development machine as tftp host set ip to serverip: sudo ifconfig <your network interface> 192.178.27.1 Now install tftp and configure accordingly: sudo apt-get install tftpd Go to /etc/tftpd.d and create a file called tftp . Copy the following content into the file for configuration: # description: The tftp server serves files using the trivial file transfer # protocol. The tftp protocol is often used to boot diskless # workstations, download configuration files to network-aware printers, # and to start the installation process for some operating systems. service tftp { socket_type = dgram protocol = udp wait = yes user = root server = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd server_args = -s /home/cpeacock/export # disable = yes per_source = 11 cps = 100 2 } Make directory according to server line in config: sudo mkdir usr/sbin/in.tftpd Copy the uImage and the am335x-boneblack.dtb to the tftp directory and boot your BBB with ethernet connection enabled to your development machine.
